        Team vRhythms is known for its brilliant leadership which has over 30
        years of experience in various setups ranging from Consumer to
        Enterprise, Products to Services and from Local markets to Global
        setups. Hence our best practices come from a lineage of gurus who have a
        collective wisdom generated as a result of discussion with peers and
        mentors, some amount of trial and errors, learning from success and
        failures and mulling over observations on teams which have been highly
        effective in dealing with Offshore Product development.

        Following are some aspects, we believe, play a significant role in
        crossing the chasm of effective Product Development in a Global Setup:
        Planning your offshore product development program and ensure buy-in by
        all stakeholders Instilling the feeling of "one team", mutual trust and
        rapport helps in keeping communication inclusive and open A model
        aligned with business objectives that encourages work partitioning and
        clarity in roles and responsibilities which in turn motivates the team
        and increases operational efficiency Balanced organization structure
        with a pyramid of skillset and experience profile at each site Teams to
        leverage technology and tools (emails, audio/video conferencing,
        net-meeting, webcasts, instant messenger, blogs and wikis) to exchange
        information and keep communication channels open Project planning and
        management: metrics-based approach used to drive project scope, quality
        and risk management decisions at various levels Strong management team
        fine tunes their style based on different team dynamics and the talent
        pool profile
